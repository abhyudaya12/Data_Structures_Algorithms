#Function Call
print(minimizeJumps(arr))

# Explaination:
Mapping Element Indices:

The function starts by creating a dictionary unmap that maps each unique element in the array to a list of indices where it occurs.

Breadth-First Search (BFS):

The function then performs a BFS traversal of the array to find the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the end. It maintains a queue q to store indices to visit next and a boolean array visited to mark visited indices.

Main BFS Loop:

Inside the BFS loop, it dequeues an index curr from the queue and checks if curr is the last index of the array. If it is, the function returns count // 2, where count is the number of iterations of the BFS loop. This is because each BFS iteration accounts for two jumps (forward and backward).

Then, it checks if curr + 1 and curr - 1 are valid positions to visit. If so, it enqueues them and marks them as visited.

Next, it iterates over all occurrences of the same element as arr[curr] (if any) using the unmap dictionary. For each occurrence (child), if it has not been visited yet, it enqueues it and marks it as visited.

After processing all occurrences of arr[curr], it removes arr[curr] from the unmap dictionary since all occurrences have been considered for the current jump.

Incrementing Jump Count:

After processing all indices at the current distance from the starting index, it increments the jump count count.

Return:

Finally, the function returns count // 2, as mentioned earlier.

Driver Code:

The driver code initializes an array arr and calls the minimizeJumps() function with this array. The result is then printed.
