Question:
Minimize maximum adjacent difference in a path from top-left to bottom-right

Given a matrix arr[][] of size M * N, where arr[i][j] represents the height of the cell (row, col). The task is to find a path from top-left to bottom-right such that the value of the maximum difference in height between adjacent cells is minimum for that path.

Note: A path energy is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the path.

Python Solution:
#starts from here
from collections import deque

def minMaxPath(arr):
    m, n = len(arr), len(arr[0])
    directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]  # Right, Down, Left, Up

    # Helper function to check if a cell is valid and within the bounds of the matrix
    def isValid(x, y):
        return 0 <= x < m and 0 <= y < n

    # Helper function to perform BFS
    def bfs(limit):
        visited = set()
        queue = deque([(0, 0)])
        visited.add((0, 0))

        while queue:
            x, y = queue.popleft()

            if x == m - 1 and y == n - 1:  # Reached bottom-right cell
                return True

            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if isValid(nx, ny) and (nx, ny) not in visited and abs(arr[nx][ny] - arr[x][y]) <= limit:
                    queue.append((nx, ny))
                    visited.add((nx, ny))

        return False

    # Binary search for the minimum possible maximum difference
    left, right = 0, max(max(row) for row in arr)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if bfs(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1

    return left

# Example usage:
arr = [
    [5, 4, 8, 7],
    [3, 6, 9, 8],
    [2, 5, 7, 9],
    [4, 8, 7, 3]
]
print("Minimum maximum adjacent difference:", minMaxPath(arr))



## Explaination:

In the code we first select a limit (maximum energy) and then with the help of BFS we search if path exists between left and right (minimum and maximum energies)
Mid is always the half of left and right (min and max energy values)
