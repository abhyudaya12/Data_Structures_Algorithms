# Types and how to handle them
In breadth-first search (BFS) related questions, you may encounter various types of trees or graphs. Here are some common types along with their representations and how to handle them in BFS-related questions:

### Binary Tree (Object with Data, Left, and Right):

Representation: Each node contains data along with pointers to its left and right child nodes.
Handling: You can perform BFS on a binary tree by traversing level by level, starting from the root node and visiting nodes level by level from left to right.
### Binary Search Tree (BST):

Representation: Similar to a binary tree, but with the additional property that for any node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than its value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than its value.
Handling: BFS traversal on a BST is similar to that on a binary tree. Start from the root and visit nodes level by level.
### General Tree (Object with Data and Children):

Representation: Each node contains data along with a list or array of pointers to its child nodes.
Handling: BFS traversal on a general tree involves traversing level by level, starting from the root node and visiting children nodes in the order they appear in the children list.
### Graph (Adjacency List or Adjacency Matrix):

Representation:
Adjacency List: Each node contains a list of its neighboring nodes.
Adjacency Matrix: A matrix where each cell (i, j) represents whether there is an edge between nodes i and j.
Handling: For BFS traversal on a graph represented by an adjacency list, start from a given node and visit its neighbors level by level. You can use a queue to keep track of nodes to visit. For an adjacency matrix, BFS can also be performed similarly, but you need to iterate through all nodes to find neighbors.
### Undirected Graph or Directed Graph:

Representation:
Undirected Graph: Each edge connects two nodes without direction.
Directed Graph: Each edge connects two nodes with a direction.
Handling: BFS traversal can be performed similarly for both undirected and directed graphs. In the case of a directed graph, consider the direction of edges while traversing.
### Weighted Graph:

Representation: Similar to a graph, but each edge has a weight associated with it.
Handling: BFS traversal can still be performed on a weighted graph. However, you might need to adjust the traversal logic based on the weights of edges, depending on the specific problem requirements.
When solving BFS-related questions involving these types of trees or graphs, it's essential to understand the specific characteristics of each type and adapt your BFS traversal algorithm accordingly.
